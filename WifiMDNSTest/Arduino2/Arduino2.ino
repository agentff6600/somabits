  // look for, you're good to go.

  // port 80 here, the standard HTTP port.
  // The last argument is the protocol type of the service, either TCP or UDP.
  // Of course, our service is a TCP service.
  // With the service registered, it will show up in a mDNA/Bonjour-enabled web
  // browser. As an example, if you are using Apple's Safari, you will now see
  // the service under Bookmarks -> Bonjour (Provided that you have enabled
